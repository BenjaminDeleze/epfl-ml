Applied Data Science: Machine Learning

The project (ML2) has been submitted in github. The main question I have is the following:

Looking at the results dataframe, the best model to classify images is the Multilayer fully-connected network with an accuracy of 95%.
However, i had some issues in extracting the final array with the test results. It would be great to have some guidance on this.

For the reason above, I used the Logistic regression to produce the .npy file with the predictions.
